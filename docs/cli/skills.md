## Commands

```bash
aikaclaw skills search "calendar"
aikaclaw skills install <slug>
aikaclaw skills install <slug> --version <version>
aikaclaw skills update <slug>
aikaclaw skills update --all
aikaclaw skills list
aikaclaw skills list --eligible
aikaclaw skills info <name>
aikaclaw skills check
```

`search`/`install`/`update` use ClawHub directly and install into the active
workspace `skills/` directory. `list`/`info`/`check` still inspect the local
skills visible to the current workspace and config.
